Summary
=======

This dataset describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens] (http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. It contains 47644977 ratings for 34308 movies. These data were created by 247853 users between January 09, 1995 and January 29, 2016. This dataset was generated on January 29, 2016.

Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 1 movies.

The data are contained in three files, `users.csv`, `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv`. More details about the contents and use of all these files follows.

NOTE: We have added only 100 records for every file in GIT for reference purpose. Actual data set can be referred from HDFS at /user/hdfs/movie_lens_data.

Content and Use of Files
========================

Formatting and Encoding
-----------------------

The dataset files are written as [comma-separated values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files with a single header row. These files are encoded as UTF-8. If accented characters in movie titles or tag values (e.g. Mis√©rables, Les (1995)) display incorrectly, make sure that any program reading the data, such as a text editor, terminal, or script, is configured for UTF-8.

User Ids
--------
MovieLens users were selected at random for inclusion. Their ids have been anonymized. User ids are consistent between `ratings.csv` and `users.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same user across the two files).

Movie Ids
---------
Only movies with at least one rating or tag are included in the dataset. These movie ids are consistent with those used on the MovieLens web site (e.g., id `1` corresponds to the URL <https://movielens.org/movies/1>). Movie ids are consistent between `ratings.csv` and `movies.csv`.


-----------------------------------------
Ratings Data File Structure (ratings.csv)
-----------------------------------------
All ratings are contained in the file `ratings.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:

    userId,movieId,rating,timestamp

The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId. Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).
Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.
